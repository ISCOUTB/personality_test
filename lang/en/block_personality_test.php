// Detailed MBTI Type Descriptions

They tend to act logically and orderly, especially in situations requiring structure or planning. Under pressure, they remain calm and seek practical solutions, relying on experience and facts. Their strength lies in their reliability and commitment, though they may appear inflexible when facing changes or unconventional ideas. They need to learn to adapt more fluidly and appreciate emotional perspectives as well.';
$string['mbti_isfj'] = 'ISFJs are kind, detail-oriented, and dedicated to caring for others. In environments with tension or uncertainty, they typically respond with empathy and serenity, seeking to maintain harmony. They are guided by values of responsibility and service, rarely overlooking the needs of those around them. However, they tend to overload themselves trying to please or help, forgetting their own limits. They benefit from learning to express their own needs and accepting that they cannot control everything.';
$string['mbti_infj'] = 'INFJ individuals act driven by strong intuition and a deep sense of purpose. In relationships, they are empathetic and seek authentic connections; in adverse moments, they tend to withdraw to reflect and find meaning in the experience. Their strength lies in their idealistic vision and capacity to inspire positive changes. However, they can be perfectionists or become frustrated when others don\'t share their level of commitment. Learning to let go of control and accept imperfection strengthens their wellbeing.';
$string['mbti_intj'] = 'INTJs are distinguished by their strategic thinking, independence, and desire to improve the systems around them. In challenging situations, they analyze logically, plan, and act with precision. They are ambitious and visionary, with great confidence in their ideas. Still, they may appear distant or unempathetic when prioritizing efficiency over emotions. They should remember that sensitivity is also a form of intelligence and that collaboration enriches their projects.';
$string['mbti_istp'] = 'ISTPs respond calmly and quickly to practical problems. They enjoy experimenting, exploring, and finding creative solutions in the moment. In adverse situations, they trust their ability to improvise rather than rigid plans. Their independent and logical nature allows them to act with precision, though they may sometimes appear detached or avoid emotional commitments. Developing empathy and communication helps strengthen their personal and professional bonds.';
$string['mbti_isfp'] = 'ISFPs are sensitive, spontaneous, and freedom-loving. They act quietly and authentically, guided by their values and emotions. In difficult moments, they prefer to maintain peace and seek personal balance before reacting. Their strength lies in their warmth and creativity, but they may struggle to confront conflicts or make firm decisions. Learning to express their opinions and tolerate emotional discomfort allows them to grow without losing their kind essence.';
$string['mbti_infp'] = 'INFPs are idealistic, empathetic, and guided by a deep need for internal coherence. In harmonious environments they flourish, showing their creativity and compassion; but when things become tense, they may withdraw and silently process what they feel. Their greatest strength is authenticity, though they risk frustration when reality doesn\'t match their ideals. Developing tolerance for imperfection and more practical action helps them realize their dreams.';
$string['mbti_intp'] = 'INTPs are characterized by their analytical and curious mind. They love understanding the systems and theories that explain the world. In situations of uncertainty, they resort to deep reflection before acting. Their analytical capacity is a great strength, but they may get trapped in theory, avoiding action. They benefit from balancing thought and practice, as well as connecting more with their own and others\' emotions, without seeing them as a distraction from reasoning.';
$string['mbti_estp'] = 'ESTPs are energetic, bold, and challenge-loving. They act quickly, confidently, and practically, especially under pressure. In crisis situations, they usually keep a cool head and find immediate solutions. Their ability to adapt is a natural strength, though they may be impulsive or impatient with routine. Learning to plan and consider long-term consequences enhances their effectiveness and personal maturity.';
